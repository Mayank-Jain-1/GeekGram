Their salary is ${salary}.'\n```\n\n#### Requirements\n- Implement the `Employee` class as a subclass of `Person`.\n- Use inheritance to reuse the `__str__` method of the parent class.\n- Add the necessary attributes to the `Employee` class. \n\n#### Example\n\n```cmd\n>>> p = Person('John Doe', 30)\n>>> print(p)\nJohn Doe is 30 years old. \n>>> e = Employee('Jane Doe', 25, 'E001', 70000)\n>>> print(e)\nJane Doe is 25 years old and is an employee with id: E001.
